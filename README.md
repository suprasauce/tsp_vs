This is a just for fun project made to visualize the [travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

## Installation

### Windows
1. Clone the project on your local machine in your prefered directory by typing the following command in git bash/ Powershell/ CMD (or download the file yourself)

```
git clone https://github.com/suprasauce/tsp_vs.git
```

2. Install [python](https://www.python.org/) for windows if you don't have it (preferably python 3.8+). Activate a virtual environment in Powershell/ CMD by either installing virtualenv and following its instructions to make a virtual environment, or by using the venv package which comes with python by default

path_where_env_is_stored\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
(CMD)

path_where_env_is_stored\env\Scripts\activate
```

To install all the dependencies, run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the main.py file by typing the following command in CMD/ Powershell (make sure virtual env is activated) in the directory where you cloned the folder

```
python main.py
```
